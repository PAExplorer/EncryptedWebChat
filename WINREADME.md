This is the windows executable build.
In my testing this works when paired with a server running the script in python
The executable is dependent on those other files in it's directory.

As it's source code this program is distributed under the GPL-3.0 license and all that it entails.
Feel free to build it yourself if you don't trust this build. This executable was created using:

python3 -m PyInstaller --onefile .\ClientChat.py
